States how to convert PDFs to images, then how to use OCR 
to read the content from the image and store it in a text file.

For my computer:
$ pip install pytesseract
$ pip install pdf2image
$ brew install tesseract
$ brew install poppler <-- used for pdf2image, supposedly for page count

Brew is only used for Macs, yum is used for Linux, not sure what package manager
is used for other OSes.
